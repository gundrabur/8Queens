# 8 Queens Problem Solver

This Python program solves the classic 8 queens problem, which involves placing 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The program utilizes a parallelized backtracking algorithm to find all possible solutions to the problem.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (for visualization of solutions)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/gundrabur/8-queens-solver.git
   cd 8-queens-solver

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

## Usage
Run the program using Python:

python 8queens.py

The program will print the number of solutions found and display a graphical representation of each solution using Matplotlib.

## Sample Output
Number of solutions: 92
Solution 1:
[0, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 3]

Solution 2:
[0, 5, 7, 2, 6, 3, 1, 4]

...
